# BERT_SA_centralbank

This personal project uses a fine-tuned BERT model to perform Sentiment Analysis on financial statements to determine if the statement is negative, neutral or positive.

There were 2 main aims of this project: 
1) To fine-tune the base BERT model on a custom dataset
2) Create a front end web application using Flask, JS and HTML to allow users to query the model through a UI.

The dataset used was a Financial Statement Sentiment database: (https://huggingface.co/datasets/FinanceInc/auditor_sentiment).
